 *
 * @return address of a new buffer which will hold the next NAL unit
 *
 * @note If cause is ARSTREAM2_RTP_RECEIVER_CAUSE_NALU_COMPLETE, naluBuffer contains a valid NAL unit.
 * @note If cause is ARSTREAM2_RTP_RECEIVER_CAUSE_NALU_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL, any data already present in the previous NAL unit buffer will be copied by the receiver into the new buffer.
 * The previous NAL unit buffer will still be in use until the callback function is called again with the ARSTREAM2_RTP_RECEIVER_CAUSE_COPY_COMPLETE cause.
 * If the new buffer is still too small, the current NAL unit will be skipped.
 * @note If cause is ARSTREAM2_RTP_RECEIVER_CAUSE_NALU_COPY_COMPLETE, the return value and newNaluBufferSize are unused.
 * @note If cause is ARSTREAM2_RTP_RECEIVER_CAUSE_CANCEL, the return value and newNaluBufferSize are unused.
 *
 * @warning If the cause is ARSTREAM2_RTP_RECEIVER_CAUSE_NALU_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL, returning a buffer smaller than the initial value of newNaluBufferSize or a NULL pointer will skip the current NAL unit.
